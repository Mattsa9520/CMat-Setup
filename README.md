# CMat Simple Project Setup #

This is my simple C++ project setup script. All this script does is take in a relative or absolute path and then builds the skeleton of the project for you. It then displays the location of your project to you. 

## Use 
All you have to do is run the command:

```
cmat_setup [/path/to/project_name]
```
## Setup 
if the file isn't already an executable just run:

```
chmod +x cmat_setup.sh
```

Then if  you want to be able to run the command from type the following command:

```
sudo cp cmat_setup.sh /usr/bin/cmat_setup
```

Then you're already to go!
