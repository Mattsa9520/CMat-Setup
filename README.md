# CMat Simple Project Setup #

This is my simple C++ project setup script. All this script does is take in a relative or absolute path and then builds the skeleton of the project for you. It then displays the location of your project to you. 

## Use 
All you have to do is run the command:

```
CMatt++ [/path/to/project_name]
```
## Setup 
If  you want to be able to run the command from anywhere type the following command:

```
sudo cp CMatt++ /usr/local/bin/
```

Then you're already to go!
